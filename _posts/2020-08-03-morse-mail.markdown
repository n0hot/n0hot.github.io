**Morse Mail**   
A fun way to practice and increase proficiency with Morse Code. Morse Mail creates an audio file (.wav) of your message text. Send it to yourself to save in iTunes or send it to a friend as a coded message email.

Amateur Radio Elmers: Use Morse Mail to send practice text to your students!

**Morse Mail** encodes all of the alpha characters a thru z plus numbers 0 thru 9. Special characters included are, period, comma, question mark, dash, and forward slash.

Supported speed range is 5 words per minute (WPM) to 30 words per minute.

The frequency (tone) range is 400 Hz to 800 Hz.

Practice! Have fun!
